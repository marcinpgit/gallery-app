                    Clad sometimes in muddy boots, sometimes in a pair of heels, 
                    my career as a photographer often requires both sets 
                    of footwear as I follow my clients on their adventures 
                    all over the world. Catamarans, towering ballrooms, glacial lakes, 
                    rooftops, mountains, bed and breakfasts, mossy forests, craggy 
                    coastlinesâ€”my spirit is undaunted, and I am forever inspired by people, 
                    nature, wind and light.
